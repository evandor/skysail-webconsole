<h3>OSGi </h3>

<p>
    The OSGi specification describes a modular system and a service platform for the Java programming 
    language that implements a complete and dynamic component model, something that does not exist in standalone Java/VM environments. 
</p>

<p>See: <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSGi'>wikipedia</a> and the OSGi <a href='http://www.osgi.org'>homepage</a></p>

<p>This <a href='https://github.com/evandor/skysail-webconsole'>project</a> is an effort to monitor OSGi runtimes to visualize the internals for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>From the OSGi Specification:</p> 
<p>
    [OSGi] defines a unit of modularization, called a bundle. A bundle is comprised of Java classes and other resources, 
    which together can provide functions to end users. [Among others,] bundles can share Java packages among an exporter bundle and an 
    importer bundle in a well-defined way.

<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-play-circle" aria-hidden="true" style="color: orange"></span> Services</h3>

<p>From the OSGi Specification:</p> 
<p>
    In the OSGi framework, bundles are built around a set of cooperating services available from a shared service registry. 
    Such an OSGi service is defined semantically by its service interface and implemented as a service object.
