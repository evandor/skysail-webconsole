== Overview

The Application Model describes the core domain of skysail.

The central part of the the model is the *application*: it's a collection of *entities* and (aggregate) *repositories*. The entities themselves
hold multiple *fields* (describing their properties), and, each of them, *four resources* to handle GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests.

== Example

Let's say you want to define an bank account tracking application. You'd start with an application (called AccountsApplication) and define
two Entities: Account and Transaction. An account (with a name, a bank identifier and the like) serves as a container for transactions (having
an amount, a date, a comment etc). As a transaction always belongs to an account, you'd need one (aggregate root) repository only, the one
for accounts.
